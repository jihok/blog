Welcome to the first installment of my blog! Things will be getting better here over time, and I'll be posting thoughts on tech, Web3, my experience as an engineer, and whatever else comes to mind--come back to hang out any time.

You may have noticed a guestbook on the home page. The guestbook is backed by an EVM-compatible smart contract, so the messages are meant to be persisted. It's not anything spectacular, nor a product I expect to gain any real traction, but as a Solidity-curious engineer I wanted to dip my toes in. It's certainly a lot more fun than adding a Disqus integration or anything like that.

You can find the source code for the site as well as the guestbook smart contract on my [Github](https://github.com/jihok).
